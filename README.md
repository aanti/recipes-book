# Tech stack
App is based on well known React starter - **create react app**, with additional tools.
 - **React**
 - **Redux** to keep application state in one place
 - **Redux-form** to keep form state in shared place with redux store, to easily validate form fields
 - **CSS Modules** to have small, separate files with style (**SASS**) which can be imported locally in place of usage
 - **classnames** to apply multiple classnames to React components (or with additional conditions)
 - **React-helmet** to apply *body* style when modal view is on (more precisely: to hide scrollbar)
 - **uuid** to give unique id when new recipe is created
 - **enzyme**, **jest* for tests

 To run the app, just type:
 ```
 yarn install
 yarn start
 ```
 or do it with npm if you like.
 To run tests:
 ```
 yarn test
 ```
 All components from `./components` directory are tested.
 Have fun!
